Description
=================
====
A component that runs on top of NGUI's UIScrollView & UITable classes for Unity3D (i.e. It requires NGUI &amp; Unity3D) can be used with dynamic data

Instead of instantiating a Prefab for each row in the list we are instantiating a fixed pool of objects that will be 
resused according to the scroll direction.



Features
============
====

* Infinite scrolling with clipping panel
* **Only fixed height cells are supported for now**
* Basic Scroll indicator
* Quick jump (selecting a start point)
* Simple sections implementation **(section height need to be equal to the item height)**
* Click item callbacks
* **Tested on Unity v4.2.2 & Unity v4.3 and NGUI v3.0.9c**


The Demo
============
===
This demo package requires both Unity3D <http://unity3d.com> and NGUI <http://www.tasharen.com/?page_id=140> to be installed

To run the demo:

1. Create a new Unity Project
2. Import NGUI **including its examples** as the demo uses the atlas's from the examples
3. Import InfiniteListDemo folder or simply double click on InfiniteListDemoPackage
4. Run the scene (InfiniteListDemo)

Main Classes & Methods
===========
===
##InfiniteListPopulator 
The main controller script that can be attached to a gameobject (e.g. the panel)

Some of the main methods included:

====
    	public void InitTableView(List<string> inDataList, int inNumberOfSections, List<int> inSectionsIndices)
Initializes the list (also can be called to refresh the list with new data)
####parameters:
* inDataList: the List of strings we want to display (you can change it to any type you wantâ€¦ just make sure to change the member variables types for dataList & OriginalData)
* inNumberOfSections: number of sections (int)
* inSectionIndices: List of integers. The start index of each section (not as fancy as indexpath in iOS but did the job for me)

===

   	  public void SetCursor(int inCursor)

marks where to start reading the data list (the value is 0 if not set)
####parameters:
* inCursor: int 

===
	public int GetRealIndexForItem(int itemDataIndex)

**Due to the current implementation of sections:**

GetRealIndexForItem used to get the data index excluding sections seperators

===	


	public delegate void InfiniteItemIsPressed(int itemDataIndex, bool isDown);
	public event InfiniteItemIsPressed InfiniteItemIsPressedEvent;
	
	public delegate void InfiniteItemIsClicked(int itemDataIndex);
	public event InfiniteItemIsClicked InfiniteItemIsClickedEvent;

Events that can be listened to if required

====

##InfiniteItemBehaviour and InfiniteSectionBehaviour
Scripts attached to the row item prefab & section prefab **(Note: the item prefab need to be tagged as "listItem" and the section prefab as "listSection")** 

Both checks for the visiblity of the item when the list start scrolling and notifiy the InfiniteListPopulator when the items becomes invisible
